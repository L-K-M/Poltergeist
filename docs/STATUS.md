# Status & next steps

Living snapshot of where Poltergeist is, what's proven, and what to pick up
next. Read [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) first for how to build/test.

_Last updated: 2026-08-30 — repository infrastructure landed; plan in
progress._

## Done

| Area | State |
|---|---|
| Repo infrastructure | CI (`ci.yml`: Dart analyze+test now; Flutter + client-matrix jobs self-activate when `app/poltergeist_app` appears), GLM PR review workflow, release workflow (`v*` tags → per-platform client assets), `scripts/build.sh` / `release.sh` / `package-linux.sh` adapted from Séance, Unlicense, analyzer config, pub workspace. |
| `poltergeist_core` | Scaffold only: product identity constants + a test guarding the ASCII-name invariant (macOS codesign rejects accented bundle file names). Real modules land per the plan. |
| Plan | In progress — arriving as reviewed PRs into `docs/plan/`. |

## Open items

1. **The plan** (`docs/plan/`) — product/UX spec, architecture and the
   Séance code-sharing strategy, sync engine design, editor design,
   milestones + testing + implementation playbook.
2. **Implementation** — follows the plan, milestone by milestone. Do not
   start before the plan's overview and the relevant chapter are merged.

## Housekeeping

- No server component is planned: bookmark backup uses Séance's sync server
  (E2E-encrypted blobs). Poltergeist's release ships client artifacts only.
- `media-sources/poltergeist-icon.png` (the master icon) is created together
  with the app scaffold; `scripts/package-linux.sh` requires it.
